## Why is Opaque not yet 1.0?

This library is built on top of `opaque-ke`(https://github.com/facebook/opaque-ke) which implements the [OPAQUE protocol](https://cfrg.github.io/draft-irtf-cfrg-opaque/draft-irtf-cfrg-opaque.html). Since the protocol is not af finshed RFC yet, we are waiting for the final version before we release a 1.0 version of this library.

**Note**: According to authors of the RFC it's unlikely that the protocol will change.

In addition `opaque-ke` has been audited and is used in production for the WhatsApp end-to-end backups.
