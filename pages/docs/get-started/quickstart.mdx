# Quickstart

If you would like to spin up a quick example locally you can use one of our examples.

The following command will create a new directory called `fullstack-simple-nextjs`.

```bash
npx create-opaque@latest fullstack-simple-nextjs
```

You then can install the dependencies with `npm install`, start the server with `npm dev` and open the browser with `localhost:3000` to see a simple example of Opaque in action.

## In-depth Walkthrough

If you prefer an in-depth walkthrough, consider following the [Add to Existing Project](/docs/get-started/add-to-existing-project) guide.
