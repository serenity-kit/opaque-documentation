### Key Stretching

The password input is passed through a key stretching function before being used in the OPRF. The key stretching function is [`argon2id`](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9106.html). Depending on the application these parameters can be adjusted using param `keyStretching` in the `opaque.client.startRegistration` and `opaque.client.startLogin` functions.

Available options are:

#### Memory constrained (default)

This is the default in case the option is omitted. It is based on the recommendation for memory-constrained environments in the [Argon2 RFC](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9106.html#section-4-6.2). It was chosen as a default based on this [feedback](https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-opaque/issues/467#issuecomment-2489262322).

Parameters:

- Memory: 2^16
- Iterations: 3
- Parallelism: 4

```ts
{
  keyStretching: "memory-constrained";
}
```

**Note**: This configuration is faster, but less secure. `client.finishRegistration` and `client.finishLogin` each take around 1 seconds to complete on a MacBook Pro M1, 2020, 16 GB Memory.

#### RFC Draft Recommended

This options is based on the recommendation in the [Configurations section in the OPAQUE protocol](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-opaque-17.html#name-configurations) with the exception that the memory is set to (2^21)-1 instead of (2^21) since we noticed (2^21) caused it to crash when running the registration in a browser environment.

Parameters:

- Memory: 2^21-1
- Iterations: 1
- Parallelism: 4

```ts
{
  keyStretching: "rfc-draft-recommended";
}
```

**Note**: This configuration is the most secure but also the slowest. `client.finishRegistration` and `client.finishLogin` each take around 13 seconds to complete on a MacBook Pro M1, 2020, 16 GB Memory.

#### Custom

You can also provide custom parameters for the key stretching function. The parameters are passed directly to the `argon2id` function. In case you provide an invalid configuration, the function will throw an error.

```ts
const memory = 65536;
const iterations = 3;
const parallelism = 1;
{
  keyStretching: {
    "argon2id-custom": {
      memory,
      iterations,
      parallelism,
    },
  };
}
```
