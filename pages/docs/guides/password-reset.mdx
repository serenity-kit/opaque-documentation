# Password Reset

Having a password reset feature is a common requirement for most applications. This guide demonstrates how to implement a password reset using Opaque.

The idea is that the user will request a password reset and then go through the same process as the registration flow except that the user will be updating their password instead of creating a new account.

## Example Application

We built an example application which you can find in the `example` directory. You can run them locally by creating the server and client projects using the following commands:

```bash
npx create-opaque@latest client-with-password-reset
npx create-opaque@latest server-with-password-reset
```

The code can be found here:

- Server with password reset: [https://github.com/serenity-kit/opaque/tree/main/examples/server-with-password-reset](https://github.com/serenity-kit/opaque/tree/main/examples/server-with-password-reset)
- Client with password reset: [https://github.com/serenity-kit/opaque/tree/main/examples/client-with-password-reset](https://github.com/serenity-kit/opaque/tree/main/examples/client-with-password-reset)

## User flow

1. User clicks on the "Forgot password?" call to action.
2. User enters their username and clicks on the "Request Password Reset" button.
3. The server sends an email to the user with "Reset Code".
4. User enters the "Reset Code" and their new password. Then clicks on the "Reset Password" button.
