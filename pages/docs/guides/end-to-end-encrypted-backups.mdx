# End-to-end encrypted backups

The main idea behind it is to be able to to encrypt any kind of data locally and then upload it to the server for it to be retrieved later.

While a simple `sodium.crypto_secretbox_easy` could do the trick here we are introducing a version that offers a couple of extra features and properties:

- allow to create a recovery token that can be used to recover the data in case the user loses the password
- allow to add meta data to the encrypted data, that can be seen by the server
- make sure the meta data for the server is encrypted when sending or receiving it from the server
- the server should be able to verify the authenticity of the data send by the client
- clients should be able to verify the authenticity of the data received from the server

## Default Workflows

### Create and store the Locker

```ts
// client session 1

// 1. login via opaque and get the export and session key
// 2. create a locker
const locker = createLocker({
  // can be a string or a Uint8Array
  data: JSON.stringify({ notes: ["What a great day"] }),
  // must be JSON serializable, but can be left empty as well
  publicAdditionalData: {
    reminder: { text: "Review notes", due: "2025-08-22" },
  },
  exportKey,
  sessionKey,
});
// 3. send the locker to the server
```

```ts
// server

// 1. validate the locker and decrypt the publicAdditionalData
const { publicAdditionalData } = validateLockerAndDecryptPublicAdditionalData({
  locker,
  sessionKey,
});
// 2. store the locker in the DB
const storyEntry = {
  ciphertext: locker.ciphertext,
  nonce: locker.nonce,
  publicAdditionalData: JSON.stringify(publicAdditionalData),
  reminderText: publicAdditionalData?.reminder?.text,
  reminderDue: publicAdditionalData?.reminder?.due,
  userId: "abc", // so we can identify who the locker belongs to
};
```

### Retrieve and decrypt the Locker

```ts
// client
// 1. login via opaque and get the export and session key
```

```ts
// server
// 1. create locker for this specific session
const locker = createLockerForClient({
  ciphertext: storyEntry.ciphertext,
  nonce: storyEntry.nonce,
  publicAdditionalData: JSON.parse(storyEntry.publicAdditionalData),
  sessionKey, // can be a different sessionKey of a new session
});
// 2. send the locker to the client
```

```ts
// client
// 1. decrypt the locker
const { data, publicAdditionalData } = decryptLocker({
  locker,
  sessionKey,
  exportKey,
});
```

## Example

## Authorization

To identify the user a session entry is stored in the DB. It contains the following fields:

- authorizationToken
- sessionKey
- userId

The `authorizationToken` is created based on the sessionKey using our session util `createAuthorizationToken`. It is sent with every request to the server and is used to identify the user.

### Endpoints

- `POST /api/locker/store` - create a locker
- `GET /api/locker/retrieve` - retrieve the user's locker

Whenever a new locker is created it overwrites the old one.

In the DB we store the following fields:

- ciphertext
- nonce
- publicAdditionalData
- userId

## Decisions

### Encrypting the publicAdditionalData between the client and server

While relying on TLS is often good enough, we care about having the `publicAdditionalData` encrypted during transport. This way for example a logger logging HTTP requests on the server side can not accidentally log this data.

This imposes a bit more complexity into the API. Specifcially we need to encrypt the `publicAdditionalData` with the `sessionKey` before sending it to the server and decrypt it on the server.

### Why is it called publicAdditionalData if it's not public?

While it's not public per se we choose this name to conveigh that it's not end-to-end encrypted data. It's data that is encrypted with the `sessionKey` and can be seen by the server. And since service databases can leak it's best to consider this data public.

### Why can't I use the sessionKey as authorizationToken?

The `sessionKey` is used to encrypt the `publicAdditionalData`. If it would be sent unencrypted with the HTTPS headers a logger observing the traffic could decrypt the `publicAdditionalData`.

By using a key derivation function (KDF) we can create a token that is based on the `sessionKey` but can not be used to decrypt the `publicAdditionalData` and the `sessionKey` can't be recovered from the `authorizationToken`.
