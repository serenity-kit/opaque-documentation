# Password Strength

> Password strength is a measure of the effectiveness of a password against guessing or brute-force attacks [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength)

With Opaque the server never sees the password, so it can't enforce any password strength rules. This means that the client is responsible for ensuring that the password is strong enough.

## Why is this important?

If an attacker can guess a user's password, they can impersonate the user and access their data. Then all the security measures in place and all the modern cryptography used to protect the data are useless.

In addition it can be seen as another measure to improve TODO

## Recommendation

While there are many ways to calculate password strength, one of the better ones is the [zxcvbn](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/wheeler) developed by Dropbox. Unfortunately, the [original JavaScript implementation](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn) is not maintained anymore.

There is a rewrite of the original zxcvbn in TypeScript called `zxcvbn-ts`. You can find it here an while we can't vouche for its quality, it seems to be the best option available at the moment. You can find the documentation at [https://zxcvbn-ts.github.io/zxcvbn/](https://zxcvbn-ts.github.io/zxcvbn/) and the source repository at [https://github.com/zxcvbn-ts/zxcvbn](https://github.com/zxcvbn-ts/zxcvbn).
