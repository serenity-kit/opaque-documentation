# End-to-end encrypted applications

Opaque is a great building block for building end-to-end encrypted applications.

Every time the register or login process is finished, the client has access to a private key only available to the client. This is the `export_key`. The key is not available to the server and it is stable. Meaning if you log in multiple times your `export_key` will stay the same.

This opens up a lot of possibilities for building end-to-end encrypted applications.

Here are a couple of examples how the `export_key` can be used:

- Digital locker to store encrypted data that can only be decrypted after a successful login.
- Seed for a private/public key pair to sign and/or encrypt data with other users.

## Digital locker

A digital locker is a great way to store encrypted data that can only be decrypted after a successful login.

TODO libsodium example

## Private/public key pair

TODO libsodium signing example
TODO libsodium encryption example

TODO should we use a KDF to derive the key from the export_key?
